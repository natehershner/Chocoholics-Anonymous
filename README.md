# Chocoholics Anonymous
Software Engineering Computer Science course project involving seeing a project through ideation and creation. Implemented Agile software development with five other group members. Tasked with creating software for the Chocoholics Anonymous company, which provides services for those addicted to chocolate. This software allows providers to verify members who use the service, view the directory of services provided, and bill the company for their services. Operators can add, edit, and delete members and providers, and view the reports regarding the services provided. Managers can view reports based on the provider of the service and the member who received the service, view the total owed to individual providers, and view the breakdown of fees per provider currently owed. All users can run the main accounting procedure, which displays current members, suspended members, providers, and every provider's current amount owed, even if zero, as well as the total owed. All backend operations utilize SQL for database management. Please note the project in its current state is ENTIRELY my own.
# WARNING
This software utilizes Microsoft's SQL Server 2022. If you do not have SQL installed, please follow the tutorial included in the SQLInstall.md file before running the project.
